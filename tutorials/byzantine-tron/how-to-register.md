# How to register?

The continent B on the Evolution Land, the BYZANTINE, is based on the TRON Network. TRX, is the cryptocurrency used in the BYZANTINE, and its value fluctuates with the market.

Players need to convert fiat money \(US dollars, Canadian dollars, Pounds, etc.\) into TRX to pay for fuel in the BYZANTINE - such as buying RING, buying land, etc.

Players cannot use fiat money to purchase RING or other assets on the Evolution Land - the fiat money needs to be converted to TRX first.

Players can purchase TRX from a wallet or exchange that supports the purchase of cryptocurrency, and then transfer the TRX from the exchange to the address of which used to register Evolution Land.
