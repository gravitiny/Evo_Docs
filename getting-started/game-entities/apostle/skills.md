## Talents

Apostles have gene-decided talent attributes, as shown in the image below. These talents decide how efficiently the Apostle can perform a task, that is, the base productivity. For example, when mining, `Strength` \(the higher, the better\) and `Intelligence` \(the lower, the better\) affect the base productivity much more than other talents. Various work or tasks requires different talent sets.

## Occupations

Apostle can choose one occupation for free. He will have extra occupational productivity addition when performing this work, compared to occupation-neutral Apostles. When switching careers, a tuition fee must be paid for professional training. Each occupation will need a different talent set to determine base productivity. If an Apostle is terrible at this, he/she might be good at some other work. Then choose that occupation as his/her profession is a smart move.
