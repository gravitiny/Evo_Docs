# Job Market

Apostles need to earn a living for the owner, but what if the owner doesn't own Land? There's a Job Market for Apostles to look for a job or landowners to hire good miners.

Players need to list their Apostles on the job market; Set work period \(at least 7 days\) and daily wages \(in RING\). Other players can decide whether to hire the Apostle based on the Apostle's talent and salaries. Once employed, the Apostle will receive RINGs while the employer will get the mineral resources.
