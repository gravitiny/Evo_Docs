# Points & Lottery

10% of game revenue goes to the "[Trading Reward Pool](https://github.com/evolutionlandorg/docs/tree/2ab96551eb7d459320117c910c5d879ac9538d99/advanced/evolution-land-dao/revenue-model/README.md#trading-reward-pool)", this money is used to reward those spenders. When a player spends some money \(in the form of RING token\), a portion of the net revenue goes to the pool. The player gets some Points according to the amount he spends on a 1:1 basis. Therefore, he contributes 10 RINGs to the system revenue; he gets 10 Points. Using these Points, he can participate in the Lottery.
