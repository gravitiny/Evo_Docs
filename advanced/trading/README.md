# Trading

Almost everything in the Evolution Land that's tokenized can be traded in the in-game marketplace or at an external market. These markets can be categorized into NFT \(non-fungible token\) markets and FT \(fungible token\) exchanges according to what you want to trade.

Check out this [tokens](../../getting-started/tokens/) page to learn how to categorize assets and/or tokens.
